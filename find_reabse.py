# Explanation:
# 1. Get the original base:
# The script finds the common ancestor of the local branch and its remote counterpart using git merge-base.
# 2. Get commits since the original base:
# It uses git log to get all commits on the branch that are not present in the original base.
# 3. Check for rebased commits:
# For each commit, it compares the commit's original parent (before rebasing) with its current parent. If they are different, the commit was likely rebased.
# How to use:
# Replace "your_branch_name" with the actual name of the branch you want to analyze.
# Run the script. It will output a list of rebased commit hashes.
